                            Please contribute to the blog actively. It is a powerful tool to keep our users
                            interested in this platform and will also add to the value you can potentially provide.

                        <li>
                            Please be punctual for your appointments. If for some reason you cannot attend,
                            kindly inform the client in advance.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            In case there is a technical problem with the video/audio connection, kindly book the
                            appointment again via email or sms without any charge. This is only being fair to your client.

                            Please be aware of the fee/client volume trade off. A more reasonable consulting fee will
